# Spotify Now Listening

I'm just testing the Spotify API. This is a simple web app that displays the song that I'm currently listening to on Spotify, or last listened to if I'm not currently listening to anything. It also displays the album art for the song, and a link to the song on Spotify.

When I'm listening to a song:

When I'm not listening to a song:

![Mitolu last listened to Why I love the moon](./public/Mitolu%20last%20listened%20to%20Why%20iii%20Love%20The%20Moon.jpg)
